# Confirmate

This is work in progress. We are currently in the process of preparing the open-source release for Confirmate Core. In the mean-time you can have a sneak peak at our [UI](http://github.com/confirmate/ui) or look at the [Clouditor](http://github.com/clouditor/clouditor) project, which is the technological basis for Confirmate.
