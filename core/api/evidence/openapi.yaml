                Boundary is an entity class in our ontology. It can be instantiated and contains all of its properties as well of its implemented interfaces.
                 Represents a boundary in data processing, which can be used to define the scope of a policy or the separation between different policies. For example, a boundary could be defined around an [HttpEndpoint], so that the policy applies once data either comes in or goes out of the HTTP endpoint.

                Configuration is an entity class in our ontology. It can be instantiated and contains all of its properties as well of its implemented interfaces.
                 Represents the abstract concept of a "configuration". This is a common pattern in many programming languages, where a data structure in code represents an aggregation of configuration values. For example, in Python, the [`configparser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) module is used to read INI files, and the config values are represented as a dictionary-like object. Often, the configuration is loaded from multiple sources, such as INI files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.

                         assessment and are recent enough. In the future, this will be replaced with information in the "related" edges in
                         the resource. For now, this needs to be set manually in the evidence.

                gRPC Transcoding

                 gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
                 more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
                 that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
                 APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
                 [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
                 Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
                 and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
                 and use it for large scale production services.

                 `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
                 how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
                 path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
                 gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
                 typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.

                 Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
                 template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
                 as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
                 The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
                 the URL path.

                 Example:

                     service Messaging {
                       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
                         option (google.api.http) = {
                             get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}"
                         };
                       }
                     }
                     message GetMessageRequest {
                       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
                     }
                     message Message {
                       string text = 1; // The resource content.
                     }

                 This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:

                 - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456`
                 - gRPC: `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`

                 Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
                 automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
                 For example:

                     service Messaging {
                       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
                         option (google.api.http) = {
                             get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
                         };
                       }
                     }
                     message GetMessageRequest {
                       message SubMessage {
                         string subfield = 1;
                       }
                       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
                       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
                       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
                     }

                 This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:

                 - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo`
                 - gRPC: `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub:
                 SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`

                 Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
                 primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
                 In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
                 as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
                 message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
                 `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.

                 For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
                 specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
                 message resource collection:

                     service Messaging {
                       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
                         option (google.api.http) = {
                           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
                           body: "message"
                         };
                       }
                     }
                     message UpdateMessageRequest {
                       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
                       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
                     }

                 The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
                 representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
                 protos JSON encoding:

                 - HTTP: `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`
                 - gRPC: `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`

                 The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
                 every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
                 request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
                 the update method:

                     service Messaging {
                       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
                         option (google.api.http) = {
                           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
                           body: "*"
                         };
                       }
                     }
                     message Message {
                       string message_id = 1;
                       string text = 2;
                     }


                 The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:

                 - HTTP: `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`
                 - gRPC: `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`

                 Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
                 have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
                 the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
                 defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
                 which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.

                 It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
                 the `additional_bindings` option. Example:

                     service Messaging {
                       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
                         option (google.api.http) = {
                           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
                           additional_bindings {
                             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
                           }
                         };
                       }
                     }
                     message GetMessageRequest {
                       string message_id = 1;
                       string user_id = 2;
                     }

                 This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:

                 - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456`
                 - gRPC: `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`

                 - HTTP: `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456`
                 - gRPC: `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`

                 Rules for HTTP mapping

                 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
                    message) are classified into three categories:
                    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
                    - Fields referred by the [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body]. They
                    are passed via the HTTP
                      request body.
                    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
                      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
                      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
                      name.
                  2. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is "*", there is no URL
                  query parameter, all fields
                     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
                  3. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is omitted, there is no HTTP
                  request body, all
                     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.

                 Path template syntax

                     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
                     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
                     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
                     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
                     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
                     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;

                 The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
                 zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
                 except the `Verb`.

                 The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
                 template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
                 matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
                 is equivalent to `{var=*}`.

                 The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
                 contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
                 before the matching.

                 If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
                 `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
                 side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
                 server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
                 [Discovery
                 Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
                 `{var}`.

                 If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
                 or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
                 client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
                 The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
                 unchanged. Such variables show up in the
                 [Discovery
                 Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
                 `{+var}`.

                 Using gRPC API Service Configuration

                 gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
                 for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
                 service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
                 proto message.

                 As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
                 transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
                 `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
                 effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
                 have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
                 specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
                 configuration in the proto.

                 The following example selects a gRPC method and applies an `HttpRule` to it:

                 Special notes

                 When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
                 proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
                 specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).

                 While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
                 [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
                 Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
                 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
                 does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
                 to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
                 for multi segment variables.

                 The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
                 because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.

                 The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
                 is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
                 character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.

                 Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
                 no client library can support such complicated mapping.

                 If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
                 the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC
                 Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.
